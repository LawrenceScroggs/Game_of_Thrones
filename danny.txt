If you ever betray me I will burn you alive.
Not a Queen, a Khaleesi.
I'm no ordinary woman, my dreams come true.
Fire cannot kill a dragon.
I will answer injustice with justice.
They can live in my new world of they can die in their old one.
I'm not going to stop the wheel. I am going to break it.
All men must die but we are not men.
I'll take what is mine with fire and blood.
Is it so fare from madness to wisdom?
