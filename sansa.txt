The worst ones always live.
Does it give you joy to scare people?
There is no honor in tricks.
What do dragons eat anyway?
Many underestimated me, most of them are dead now.
I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.
I will stand behind Jon Snow.
He's a monster.
I'm a slow learner it's true, but I learn.
There are no heroes in real life, monsters always win.
