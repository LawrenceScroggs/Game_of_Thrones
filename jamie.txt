People have been swinging at me for years, they always seem to miss.
Three victories don't make you conquerer
If there are gods, why is the world so full of pain and injustice?
The things I do for love.
There are no me like me. Only me.
It was that white cloak that soiled me, not the other way around.
I think it passing odd that I am loved by one for a kindness I never did, and reviled by so many for my finest act.
I am alive, and drunk on sunlight.
Fighting bravery for a losing cause is admirable. Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding. 
A Lannister always pays their debts.
