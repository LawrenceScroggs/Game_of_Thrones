A very small can cast a very large shadow.
Chaos isn't a pit, chaos is a ladder.
The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
Winter is coming.
Everything is better with some wine in the belly.
Men are men, vows are vows and words are wind.
Hodor?
Death is certain. Time is not.
You know nothing.
Hodor, Hodor, HODOR!!!!!
