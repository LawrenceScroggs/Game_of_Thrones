My father taught me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a swoard throught their hearts.
They were born on the wrong side of the wall it doesn't make them monsters.
I put my trust in you, a stranger because I knew it was the best chance for my people all our people.
What did father used to say?  Everything before the word 'but' is horse-shit.
Sometimes their is no happy choice, only one less grievous than others.
We look up at the same stars and see such different things.
I do know some things.
The more you give a king the more he wants.
First lesson, stick them with the pointy end.
If I fall don't bring me back.
