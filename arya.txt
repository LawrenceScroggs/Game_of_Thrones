Nothing isn't better or worse than anything.  Nothing is just nothing.
Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe.
What do we say to the god of death? Not today.
Anyone can be killed.
Fear cuts deeper than swords.
I wasn't playing and I don't want to be a lady.
A bruise is a lesson and each lesson makes us better.
I'm going to kill the queen.
I am a wolf and will not be afraid.
I know death. He's got many faces.
